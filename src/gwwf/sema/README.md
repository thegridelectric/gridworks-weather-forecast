# Sema vocabulary snapshot (GENERATED)

This directory is a **vendored Sema snapshot**: a self-contained, generated
subset of the Sema vocabulary. **Never hand-edit it.** To change it, edit the
seed (`../sema_seed_request.yaml`) or the definitions in the sema repo, then
re-run the repo's `scripts/regen_sema_snapshot.sh`.

## What Sema is

Sema is a versioned vocabulary of JSON-Schema contracts governing the
serialized messages exchanged between GridWorks applications — the authority
over meaning at every durable-data and inter-app boundary. Every schema `$id`
lives under the `https://schemas.electricity.works` namespace; the canonical
registry and spec live in the sema repo
(https://github.com/thegridelectric/sema — start at `spec/primary.md`).

## Working with Sema-typed data (rules that fight default idiom)

- Construct and decode instances through the generated classes in this
  snapshot — never hand-built dicts.
- Dict/JSON keys are the PascalCase wire form; produce and consume them via
  `to_dict()` / `from_dict()`, never by spelling keys inline.
- Dispatch on decoded messages with `isinstance`, never `hasattr`.
- Narrow every codec decode (`expect=` or `assert isinstance`).
- Where a value is vocabulary-shaped, use its property format type, never
  bare `str`.
